<h3 class="align-center">Holistic bodywork</h3>
<p class="">Zenthai Shiatsu is a modern holistic bodywork modality that draws on the traditional eastern energetic based systems of <em>Zen Shiatsu</em> and <em>Traditional Thai Massage </em>as well as the structural remediation and soft tissue techniques from western <em>Osteopathy</em>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="align-center">Effective therapy</h3>
<p class="">By integrating the prime aspects of proven modalities and the creation of a safe, awake and caring healing environment, Zenthai Shiatsu has evolved to be widely recognised as an effective structural and energetic form of therapy.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr>
<h3 class="align-center">Innate healing</h3>
<p class="">Treatments involve massage, acupressure therapy, assisted stretching, joint mobilisation and facilitated movements that respect the bodies innate healing capacity.</p>
<p class="">Each session is designed simply to help your body reorganise itself back to its natural, free and balanced state.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="align-center">Focused intention</h3>
<p class="">Treatments have focused intention on restoring balance to the body systems in alignment with the <em>Five Element Theory</em> from <em>Traditional Chinese Medicine.</em></p>

<h3 class="align-center">High performance</h3>
<p>Modalities such as Yoga, CrossFit, gymnastics, dance and martial arts all share a common requirement that in order to move and perform at a high level you require flexibility, mobility and strength through a full range of motion — the very attributes developed by the Stretch Therapy™ method.</p>
