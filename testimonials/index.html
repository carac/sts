It is the most sublime experience of surrender and being 'held' while you drift in and out of the most delicious slumber. Your body deserves this!!"</blockquote><figcaption>Kelli Ann F. (Mindful Movement Coach)</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>"Sooo good! I had been getting regular remedial massages, but Craig's massage was incredible! So much deeper, inducing a detoxing response... Very holistic and thorough."<br><br>"This is so great! I had another massage with Craig yesterday, so amazed by how much I've detoxed afterwards. Really healing!!"</blockquote><figcaption>Lauren J.</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>"Hi Craig, thanks for yesterday's session. I thought I should send a message on how well this morning's run went. Best I've had in a long long time and no soreness at all. I'll have to book again in another couple of weeks to keep the body in check. Thanks so much! This has made my day."</blockquote><figcaption>Jodi D.</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>"So far I've had two sessions of Zenthai Shiatsu with Craig. He is very knowledgeable, passionate and precise. The feeling, both in mind and body after the sessions are really positive. I look forward to many more."</blockquote><figcaption>Kristin S. (Personal Trainer &amp; Yoga Teacher)</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>"I was pain free for the first time since the injury occurred, and very grateful. I was almost too scared to do anything in case the pain came back. Also, my back was not sore to touch as it had been previously."</blockquote><figcaption>Melanie T.</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>"I think you hit the nail on the head with my leg... I have not been doing any stretching with it at all. I have been avoiding using it but since your class no pain. You're a genius!"</blockquote><figcaption>Tanya Lee G.</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>"I see some similarities between Stretch Therapy and meditation. Both ask us to be attentive in our listening, to be mindful in our movements and to pay attention to the changes taking place in our experience. We learn to listen to our own thoughts without being caught up in them which allows us to let go and perhaps go a little deeper into the stretch."</blockquote><figcaption>Ericka M. (Physiotherapist)</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>"Many thanks to Craig Rackemann for presenting such a clear and defined session on keeping the body moving freely."</blockquote><figcaption>Luke H. (Strength &amp; Conditioning Coach)</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>"A very BIG thank you for a very informative workshop on Saturday. I have already incorporated a few of the stretches in my day and tried a few on my clients as well. I look forward to the next workshop, keep up the AMAZING work you are doing… it is SO very needed."</blockquote><figcaption>Kelli-Ann F. (Mindful Movement Coach)</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>"Brisbane Stretch Therapy workshop no. 2 for me — Master the Forward Bend. Well, I didn't master it, but I've never gained so much in one session! We played with straddle pancake and my chest was max a fist from the ground. It has never been that far!! Thanks Craig Rackemann!"</blockquote><figcaption>Eduardo S. (Strength &amp; Conditioning Coach)</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>"OMG loved loved loved this workshop. First stretch workshop I got useful information out of. Thanks Craig, sign me up for the next one!!!!"</blockquote><figcaption>Tanya-Lee G.</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>"So wanted to give you some feedback! On Sunday mum said her shoulder felt the best it has in years. She's always had an achey shoulder for the past few years - nothing major, no injury, probably wear and tear from handbags and carrying kids. When she's had a big weekend doing stuff - cleaning etc she often comments how much it's hurting. Doesn't stop her from anything though, but just annoying enough to be 'there'. So yeah, she said she felt amazing and best in years. Thought that was pretty cool!"</blockquote><figcaption>Selina W. (Owner @ Red E Personal Training)</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>"Saw a post on the Brisbane trail runners Facebook site at the last minute and figured my body really needed a good stretching, and the chance to learn more techniques would only help. Craig certainly didn't disappoint, really got us thinking about how our muscles and joints behave and techniques to use these aspects to improve the way we approach stretching. Friendly, approachable and extremely knowledgable is the way I would describe Craig and his method of teaching. Thanks Craig."</blockquote><figcaption>Pete T.</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>"Was soooo good! I'd happily do that every weekend (and I think my body would thank me). Thanks Craig for your expertise."</blockquote><figcaption>Jenna L.</figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote>"Thanks so much Craig Rackemann for all your amazing advice and techniques. We may have grunted and groaned a bit but I know I got so much out of it!!!"</blockquote><figcaption>Sherin C.</figcaption></figure></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><a class="logo" href="https://www.stretchtherapysessions.com/"><img src="https://www.stretchtherapysessions.com/media/website/sts-logo-inline-grey.png" alt="Stretch Therapy Sessions" width="1500" height="205"></a><nav class="footer__nav"><ul><li><a href="https://www.stretchtherapysessions.com/privacy-policy/" class="inverse" target="_self">Privacy policy</a></li><li><a href="https://www.stretchtherapysessions.com/terms-of-service/" class="inverse" target="_self">Terms of service</a></li></ul></nav><div class="footer__social"><a href="mailto://craig@stretchtherapysessions.com" class="email" aria-label="Email" title="Send email to craig@stretchtherapysessions.com"><svg class="li li-mail" width="1.125rem" height="1.125rem" fill="none" stroke="#343434" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><g><rect width="20" height="16" x="2" y="4" rx="2"/><path d="m22 7-8.97 5.7a1.94 1.94 0 0 1-2.06 0L2 7"/></g></svg> </a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/stretchtherapysessions" class="facebook" aria-label="Facebook" title="View Facebook profile"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://www.stretchtherapysessions.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.instagram.com/stretchtherapysessions" class="instagram" aria-label="Instagram" title="View Instagram profile"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://www.stretchtherapysessions.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#instagram"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright">Servicing Noosa and the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, Australia</div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'overlay',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth:'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.navbar',};</script><script defer="defer" src="https://www.stretchtherapysessions.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=b103b2211e74472ffa1a0d35c0918ecc"></script><script src="https://www.stretchtherapysessions.com/media/plugins/pagePrefetching/quicklink.umd.js"></script><script>window.addEventListener('load', () => {
