On Sunday mum said her shoulder felt the best it has in years. She’s always had an achey shoulder for the past few years - nothing major, no injury, probably wear and tear from handbags and carrying kids. When she’s had a big weekend doing stuff - cleaning etc she often comments how much it’s hurting. Doesn’t stop her from anything though, but just annoying enough to be ‘there’. So yeah, she said she felt amazing and best in years. Thought that was pretty cool!”<figcaption class="source">— Selina W.

Friendly, approachable and extremely knowledgable is the way I would describe Craig and his method of teaching.
